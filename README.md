## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python >= 3.9  
- TensorFlow â‰¥ 2.10  
- CUDA â‰¥ 11.2 (if using GPU)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains preprocessed inflow and outflow data from both subway and bus systems. These files are required to run the training and testing scripts.

### Files Description

| File Name               | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `DT_ridership_in.npy`  | Subway inflow data                     |
| `DT_ridership_ou.npy`  | Subway outflow data                    |
| `GJ_DT_flowin.npy`     | Bus inflow data                        |
| `GJ_DT_flowou.npy`     | Bus outflow data                       |
| `DT_ADJ.csv`           | Static adjacency matrix for subway     |

Ensure the data files are placed in the correct paths as expected in the code.  
If you do not have access to the dataset, please contact the author.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

You can run a test prediction using random input as follows:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
test_input = tf.random.normal((32, 12, 329, 2))
prediction = model.predict(test_input)
print("Prediction shape:", prediction.shape)
```

For training with real data, make sure to preprocess the data as shown in the scripts and then train using the model defined in `main_model.py`.
