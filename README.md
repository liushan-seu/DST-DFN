# ðŸš‡ðŸšŒ Subway passenger flow prediction considering subway-bus transfer:A dynamic spatiotemporal decomposition and gate fusion network

---

## ðŸ“¦ Environment Setup

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python >= 3.9  
- TensorFlow â‰¥ 2.10
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- CUDA â‰¥ 11.2 (if using GPU)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains preprocessed inflow and outflow data from both subway and bus systems. These files are required to run the training and testing scripts.

### Files Description

| File Name               | Description                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `DT_ridership_in.npy`  | Subway inflow data                     |
| `DT_ridership_ou.npy`  | Subway outflow data                    |
| `GJ_DT_flowin.npy`     | Bus inflow data                        |
| `GJ_DT_flowou.npy`     | Bus outflow data                       |
| `DT_ADJ.csv`           | Static adjacency matrix for subway     |

Ensure the data files are placed in the correct paths as expected in the code.

## ðŸ§ª Project Status

This project is still **under active development**.  
We are continuously working on:

- Adding support for projects that only use subway data.  
- Providing trained model weights 

Stay tuned for updates!
